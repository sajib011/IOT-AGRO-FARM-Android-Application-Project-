# IOT-AGRO-FARM-Android-Application-Project-
My thesis was on the Development of IoT-based smart security and  monitoring systems for the agricultural farm. It was a group project. We  are focusing on the latest technologies like sensors to IoT to have a great  change in the field of agriculture by collecting data from soil moisture,  temperature, humidity, unwanted trespassing and then finding the best  optical solutions for any situation. We researched our way into how are  going to have a transparent relation between software and hardware. In this project, my part was a literature review, design functionalities,  hardware selection, design thinking, system visualization methodology,  UI design, complete work schedule &amp; coding, etc. Amid tools and  technology, we used app development (Flutter, Android Studio, Dart),  database (MySQL), &amp; programming language (Java, PHP, Arduino), etc.
